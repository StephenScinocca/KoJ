Knights of Justice Discord Bot

This bot is used to play the game knights of Justice made by denizenquinn on reddit. It is a 2 player game designed for DnD campaigns that I made into a playable discord bot. As of now it is NOT a 24/7 bot so if you want to run it you have to run it on your own computer.

The idea is that you get 6 dice rolls, then draft 3 rounds of knights and square off each round with the chosen knight and any number of the dice you currently have. If you wn a round, you get 1 point, and if you draw both players get 1 point. The winner is the player that first reaches 2 points, or if both players have 2 points after 2 rounds, then the winner is the person with 3 points. 

A list of the rules and how the game is played in detail can be found here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730974585209487411/794111063079125042/test2.png 

Have fun!!
